                    My name is Trent, I live in Philippines and I'm currently pursuing a degree in Computer Science. <br><br>

                    My hobbies are regretting my past, a bit of piano, rarely programming, and video games.
                    I'm hoping to learn guitar and japanese these year. Watashi wa tamago desu <br><br>

                    My personality strengths are being passionate and having fun at things I do.
                    I try as much as possible to reciprocate people's hard work and keep a positive attitude to others.
                    I communicate well especially within academic or business context, but outside that I'm a complete NPC. <br><br>

                    As much I'd hate to admit it, I don't know how to talk to people.
                    Such a price I pay for being locked up on my computer instead of going outside.
                    I aspire to be my like my friends who still keeps me around despite being the weird guy from the group.
                    Thank you guys ðŸ˜­.

                    A very memorable family picture <br><br>
                    I come from a Family of 4, but there is like 3 families living in our house right now <br><br>
                    I have a loving parents who both work to raise us both brothers.
                    And I have a little brother who loves to wake me up at the middle of the night playing video games. <br><br>
                    The family picture presented is my Dad's family side, which I consider I'm more close to,
                    because I rarely meet my Mom's side (or never at all). <br><br>
                    I'm thankful for parents who would always trust and support the decisions I make for myself.
                    They've taught me the values of doing what's right for myself instead of dealing with unnecessary academic pressures.
